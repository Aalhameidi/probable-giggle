            <h1>How to improve your programming skills</h1>
            <h4>In this post, we will explore the ways people improve their
                 skills in programming.</h4>
         

     <p>Breaking into the tech industry is a challenge. No doubt about that. especially for an entry-level job where
         the demand is growing and so do the requirements. For many of the great tech companies on earth, it is no longer 
         enough to have an academic degree.In fact, many of the high-end companies don't even consider that for technical positions.
         The good news is that today everyone can become a software developer. The know-how is out there 
         available in online courses, coding challenges, video tutorials, and a handful of programming blogs 
         and magazines. However, getting hired as a programmer is definitely not an easy task, even for people 
         that have an academic background in computer science or software engineering.
        I'll start with my conclusion by saying that learning software development is more like a marathon than a sprint. 
        It a full-time effort that requires the discipline to improve a bit every day. So the key to success is consistent 
        improvement in baby steps.Acquiring the right skillset When most people think about the skillset a developer 
        needs to have they refer to what tech stack they should master or what programming languages they should know. 
        Although it is true, many experienced programmers would mention a wider range of skills that are necessary
         beyond writing good code, clean code, or any other hardcode coding skills.</p>
