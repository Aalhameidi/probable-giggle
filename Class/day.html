            <h1>My First Day at University</h1>
            <h4>In this post, I will take you with me in my first day at univeristy</h4>
         

                 
        
       <div style="text-align: left" > <p> I got up early that morning due to an improper sleep during the previous night. 
                 It was brought on by my fear of beginning anew in my new life.   
                 I arrived an hour early than necessary on my first day since I was worried about 
                 being late and chose to spend some time at the cafe shop next to the university. 
                 I wanted to know what was going to happen next, therefore I was hoping that time 
                 would pass much more quickly.  When it was finally the time to head back to the campus,
                 I hoped for everything to go on smoothly, just as how I expected it.</p>
